Welcome to the README page for the PID-Based Self-Balancing Robot project!

This project is aimed at building a self-balancing robot using PID control. A video demonstrating the PID tuning process for the robot can be found at https://youtu.be/xGh2a6OMHAA. Additionally, a presentation outlining the project can be found at https://youtu.be/MON0uazeGzo.

The goal of this project is to create a robot that can balance on two wheels using feedback control. PID control is used to adjust the robot's position based on sensor measurements, allowing it to maintain its balance.

The code for the project can be found in the repository, along with instructions for building and running the robot. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to open an issue or pull request.
